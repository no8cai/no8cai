### About me:

I am a former geophysicist turned software developer, with a passion for leading edge technology. I have recently graduated from App Academy, where I acquired a deep understanding of full-stack development and honed my programming skills. I have completed several projects including a full-stack clone of Airbnb, Kickstarter, and Amazon, showcasing my ability to build and implement complex systems. I am eager to continue my growth in the tech industry and am open to new opportunities and challenges
